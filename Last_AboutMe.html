           My name is Shreyas Tulsi and my plan shortly is to either become a Professional Golf Player or dive deep into the world of artificial intelligence. To achieve my second goal, I will take all of the classes in high school necessary like CSP Principles and AP CSP, to be admitted into a school with strong computer science resources. From there I will use those experiences taught to me in college, and apply them going into my work career. During this time, I will also be working on creating my projects to help me be an expert in the field of Artifical Intelligence.
            <!--Three seperate paragraphs about myself as instructed by the directions, and a break between each one to show the changing of paragraphs -->

           One characteristic that I believe will lead me to success, no matter what field I go into, is my uncanny ability to stay persistent until a problem is completed. For example, when I am completing activities like homework, a coding project or even a physical activity; my mind doesn't come to rest until the problem is completed. I believe this persistence will keep me going through the struggles of my life, making me stronger and better prepared to complete the tasks at hand then my peers. Some of my major accomplishments was getting in the top 1% of all Cyber Patriot Teams, Winning Highest Scorers award in Math Olympiad, and becoming an Instructor at Empower Martial Arts. During my work experience of teaching martial arts, I was able to learn how to display information that is not only informative; but also engaging, which I believe is one of the most important skills a person can have
          </p>
           <br>
          <p>
            Using all of these learned skills, experiences and personal strengths, I believe that I would be an extremely capable employee for any software development company. If you would like to the things I have discussed in greater detail, please head over to the rest of my pages. Thank you very much for giving me a chance, and I hope that I can be resourceful to you in some way!
