  <p>Summary of Project </br>
    <br>
    This project was centered around a fictional company called Bikes, Boards and Beyond. Our task was to configure this company with the best security polcies and equipment as possible. We therefore indentified all of our needs, determined what parts needed to be secure, and then created a possible topology. To view this project, click the link below. <br>

   <h3>1.2.5</h3>
   <h5>Summer 2020</h5>
   <p>This project is centered around following the steps of the Cyber Security life cycle, in order to to secure a machine. We found all of the vulnerbailities that existed within the machine, made them more secure, and then tested if they worked. In the presentation below, the entire process is document, so you can check it out.</p>

   <h4><b>Python Project</b></h4>
   <h3>TicTacToe.py</h3>
   <h5>January, 2020</h5>
   <p>TicTacToe.py was a game I created, in which a user could play a fully-functional game of TicTacToe against a computer opponent. To create the game board, I assigned each portion of the board to a certain index, making it simple to replace the white space, with an 'X' or a 'O'. To have a cleaner interface, I used pythons system module to clear the terminal after each turn. Try and see if you can defeat the C.P.U in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with the link below! </br></p>

   <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
   <h5>October 2019(CSP CLASS)</h5>
   <h5>Head Soccer- Collaboration with Mason Valentine</h5>
   <p>If I made Head Soccer just a one player-game with a constant opponent, people would have eventually gotten bored of the game and stop playing. Due to this reason, I needed to find a way in which I could keep increasing the difficulty(essentially increasing the skill of the opposition). The way I did this was by controlling the reactiveness of the C.P.U concerning the player's movements. As you completed a series of levels, the C.P.U's delay would be reduced everytime by 500 milliseconds. This way, the player constantly felt challenged and experienced a true sense of accomplishment when they finished. An extremely important lesson I learnt was how my program to appeal to an audience, and keep them attracted.</br>
